    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">With age and pregnancy, numerous changes occur in women. One such key change is a loose vagina with which comes various problems (both physical and mental). The elastic muscles of the vagina may expand due to two reasons- childbirth and age. The stretching of the muscles in childbirth enables the delivery of the baby. And as a woman ages, there are several hormonal factors that reduce the strength of the muscles of the pelvic floor. This can result in the loss of elasticity and tightness, thinning of the vaginal walls, and a general laxity (looseness) of the vagina. Such loss of elasticity can lead to painful sex, difficulty to achieve orgasms, stress urinary incontinence, and loss of confidence. 

<br>What is Vaginal Tightening?

Vaginal tightening is a surgical procedure that tightens the loose muscles of the vagina caused by childbirth, age congenital, or hormonal reasons. The procedure promises to restore the strength and elasticity of vaginal muscles, thereby enabling better orgasms, better lubrication, and pleasurable intercourse. Vaginal tightening is also known to eliminate issues such as vaginal dryness and stress urinary incontinence, which leads to an increase in confidence in women. 

One of the best things about vaginal tightening is that it is an excessively convenient and simple procedure. It is a completely non-invasive procedure and is done in less than twenty minutes. There is no need for anesthesia and there is no extensive recovery process or any incisions required at all. All you would need to do is follow some simple instructions given by the doctor.

<br>Who Can Consider Vaginal Tightening?

<br>Women of all ages and different walks of life can benefit from vaginal tightening. Several studies reveal that women experience psychological distress because of sexual dysfunction and unsatisfying intercourse caused due to loss of strength and tightness in the vaginal muscles. Moreover, many get stuck in embarrassing situations because of urinary incontinence. This can lead to a serious fall in a woman’s self-confidence, which is why they choose to go for vaginal tightening. 

<br>A woman can consider vaginal tightening for

<br>1. Aesthetic apprehensions

<br>Hormonal changes, age, pregnancy, and childbirth strain the vagina and weaken the pelvic muscles. As an obvious result, there is a visible increase in the vaginal diameter, poor muscle tone, and a loose, badly shaped vagina. This may cause women to feel uncomfortable or utterly self-conscious during sexual activities. Some women may feel dissatisfied by the appearance of the vagina, and they also might experience a dip in their self-confidence.

<br>2. Loss of sexual satisfaction

<br>Loss of vaginal elasticity and strength results in dissatisfying, and even painful intercourse. Reduced tightness in the vaginal walls lowers friction and sensation in sexual activities. Problems such as vaginal dryness and vaginal itching, which are associated with a loose vagina can also make sex extremely uncomfortable, and this makes sex displeasing for both women and their partners.

<br>3. Urinary stress incontinence

<br>Loss of strength in the pelvic and vaginal muscles also causes a loss of control over the bladder and urethral muscles. This can cause leakage of urine and is medically termed as urinary stress incontinence, which is yet another effect of a loose vagina. Because of stress urinary incontinence, a minor pressure on the bladder can cause leakage of urine, which can put you in pretty embarrassing situations.

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">How Does Vaginal Tightening Help?</h3>
    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">Vagina tightening can 

<br>1. Lead to better sexual satisfaction

<br>Vaginal tightening restores the strength and elasticity of the pelvic floor and the vaginal muscles and makes them tighter again. This enables the vagina to contract again and increases friction during sexual activities, which can directly result in pleasurable sex and better orgasms.

<br>2. Improve vaginal dryness and itching

<br>Vaginal dryness and itching are associated with loss of elasticity in the vagina. Vaginal tightening promises to eliminate both of these problems by restoring your vagina to its original youthful state. 

<br>3. Help to treat stress-induced urinary incontinence

<br>A little laugh, a sneeze, or even sitting and standing up can cause leakage of urine if you’re suffering from stress urinary incontinence, which is caused by a loose vagina. Vaginal tightening promises to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor and it helps you regain the control you had over your bladder. Thereby, it eliminates the problem of stress urinary incontinence.

<br>If you suffer from symptoms such as vaginal dryness, vagina itching, loss in strength of the pelvic and vaginal muscles, urinary incontinence because of hormonal changes with age, or childbirth, vaginal tightening can be the right treatment option for you. 

<br>The gynecologists at Pristyn Care, with the use of their stellar experience and non-invasive surgical techniques, can provide you effective counsel about vaginal tightening and how it helps to reverse the effects of aging on your vaginal health.</p>
